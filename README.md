## Overview of Implemtation

Created a new file named 'mandelmovie.c' that modifies the 'mandel.c' file to create 50 mandel images, each slightly altered from the last. The iteration_to_color function was modified to use the modulo to cycle RGB colors for more unique colors.

The scaling method has been changed to exponential for a smooth zoom and the default center coordinates have been changed to the Seahorse Valley values. Specify the number of children to be created using the '-c' command line argument.
